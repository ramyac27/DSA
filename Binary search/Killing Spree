There are Infinite People Standing in a row, indexed from 1.
A person having index 'i' has strength of (i*i).
You have Strength 'P'. You need to tell what is the maximum number of People You can Kill With your Strength P.
You can only Kill a person with strength 'X' if P >= 'X'  and after killing him, Your Strength decreases by 'X

Input:
N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strengths of people is 1, 4, 9, 16, .... 
and so on. WE can kill the first 3 person , 
after which our Power becomes 0 and we cant 
kill anyone else. So answer is 3


class Solution{
    
    long Strength(long n){
        long sum=(n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6;
        return sum;
    }
    
    long killinSpree(long n)
    {
        long left =0;
        long right =(long)Math.sqrt(n);
        long ans =-1;
        while(left<=right){
            long mid =(left+right)/2;
            long strength = Strength(mid);
            if(strength>n){
                right=mid-1;
            }
            else{
                ans=mid;
                left=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
